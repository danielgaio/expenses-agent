### 7. User Flow Implementation
```
User Action → Upload → Edge Function → AI Extraction → 
Pre-fill Form → User Review → Save with Provenance
```

- [ ] Implement caching for common extractions
- [ ] Add extraction history tracking

### 9. Testing & Quality
- [ ] Write integration tests for complete flow
- [ ] Add E2E tests for mobile app
- [ ] Add E2E tests for web app
- [ ] Test with real receipts (English and Portuguese)
- [ ] Test audio quality variations
- [ ] Verify confidence score accuracy
- [ ] Load testing for concurrent extractions

### 10. Performance Optimization
- [ ] Implement response caching
- [ ] Add request queuing for rate limits
- [ ] Optimize image compression before upload
- [ ] Add retry logic with exponential backoff
- [ ] Monitor API usage and costs

### 11. Security & Compliance
- [ ] Never expose OPENAI_API_KEY in client code
- [ ] Implement rate limiting per user
- [ ] Add API key rotation mechanism
- [ ] Redact sensitive data from logs
- [ ] Ensure LGPD/GDPR compliance for AI processing
- [ ] Add user consent for AI processing

### 12. Analytics & Monitoring
- [ ] Track extraction success rates
- [ ] Monitor confidence score distributions
- [ ] Log extraction failures
- [ ] Track processing times
- [ ] Monitor API costs
- [ ] Alert on high error rates

## 📋 Testing Checklist

### Unit Tests
- [x] Image extraction tests pass
- [x] Audio extraction tests pass
- [x] Text extraction tests pass
- [x] Error handling tests pass
- [x] Schema validation tests pass

### Integration Tests (To Do)
- [ ] Upload → Extract → Parse flow
- [ ] Edge Function integration
- [ ] Storage bucket integration
- [ ] Database write with provenance

### E2E Tests (To Do)
- [ ] Complete mobile app flow
- [ ] Complete web app flow
- [ ] Multi-language support
- [ ] Error recovery flows

### Manual Testing (To Do)
- [ ] Test with real receipts (10+ samples)
- [ ] Test with various audio qualities
- [ ] Test casual vs formal text
- [ ] Test edge cases (damaged receipts, background noise)
- [ ] Test both English and Portuguese

## 🐛 Known Issues & Limitations

### Current Limitations
1. **API Keys in Client**: Mobile app currently references OPENAI_API_KEY directly
   - **Fix**: Move to Edge Functions (Priority 2)

2. **No File Upload**: Assumes URLs are already available
   - **Fix**: Implement Supabase Storage upload (Priority 3)

3. **No Retry Logic**: Single API call attempt
   - **Fix**: Add retry with exponential backoff

4. **Audio File Format**: Requires URL, not local file
   - **Fix**: Convert local files to Blob/File before upload

### Future Enhancements
- [ ] Support for video extraction (future)
- [ ] Line-item breakdown for receipts
- [ ] Multi-receipt batch processing
- [ ] Receipt duplicate detection
- [ ] Historical learning from corrections
- [ ] Custom category training

## 📊 Success Metrics

Track these after implementation:
- **Extraction Success Rate**: Target >95%
- **Average Confidence Score**: Target >0.85
- **User Correction Rate**: Target <20%
- **Processing Time**: Target <3s for images, <5s for audio
- **API Cost per Extraction**: Monitor and optimize
